Imagine a world where robots walk beside us, collaborate with us, and augment our capabilities. That world is being built **right now**, and this textbook is your gateway to understanding and creating it.

**Physical AI** represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics—where digital intelligence meets physical embodiment. Unlike virtual AI that exists only in cyberspace, Physical AI systems:

- 🎯 **Perceive** the real world through advanced sensors
- 🤝 **Interact** physically with objects and humans
- 🧠 **Learn** from embodied experiences
- ⚡ **Adapt** to dynamic, unpredictable environments

This textbook focuses on **humanoid robots** as the ultimate platform for Physical AI—machines designed in our image to operate in our world.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to AI systems that interact with the real world through physical bodies (robots), sensors, and actuators. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital environments, Physical AI systems must:

- **Sense** their environment through cameras, IMUs, force sensors, and other modalities
- **Act** on the world through motors, grippers, and locomotion systems
- **Learn** from sensorimotor feedback in embodied contexts
- **Collaborate** with humans in shared physical spaces

This textbook focuses on **humanoid robots**—robots designed with human-like forms—as a platform for understanding Physical AI principles that apply broadly across robotics.

## Who This Textbook Is For

**Target Audience**: University students (ages 17-25) with STEM backgrounds

**Prerequisites**:
- Basic calculus and linear algebra
- Programming experience (Python recommended)

See the **Appendix: Setup Guide** (coming soon) for detailed platform-specific instructions (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## What Makes This Textbook Unique?

### 1. Physical AI Focus

Most robotics textbooks treat AI and robotics separately. This textbook integrates them, showing how:
- Embodiment shapes intelligence
- Sensorimotor loops enable learning
- Physical constraints inform AI design
- Human-robot collaboration defines future work

### 2. Evidence-Based Learning

Every technical claim is backed by citations from:
- Foundational textbooks (Siciliano, Craig, Spong, Murray)
- Seminal research papers (Brooks, Vukobratović, Kajita, LaValle)
- Current standards (ISO 8373, ROS2 documentation)

### 3. Reproducible Exercises

All code examples:
- Run on free, cross-platform simulators
- Include step-by-step guidance
- Provide expected outputs for validation
- Are tested in CI/CD pipelines

### 4. Future-of-Work Alignment

Chapters 8-10 emphasize skills for the AI-augmented workforce:
- Designing AI systems that complement human capabilities
- Understanding ethical implications of embodied AI
- Collaborating with AI agents in physical tasks
