## Status

These diagrams are placeholders and will be created using:
- Mermaid.js for flowcharts and diagrams (preferred for version control)
- Or exported SVG files from design tools (Inkscape, Figma, draw.io)

Students can still understand concepts from textual descriptions and code examples while diagrams are being finalized.
